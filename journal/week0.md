### 2: Implement MFA in Root user.
I enabled the MFA of my root user as shown.

### 3 and 4: Set up an IAM user account 

As a security measure to reduce the exposure of the root user, I have created a new user in AWS IAM. However, I have granted excessive permissions to the user by assigning the AdministratorAccess policy, which allows the user to access all AWS resources and services. The user will use an Access key to access these resources.

## 5: Generated AWS credentials, specifically an Access Key

I generated access keys from my IAM user so as to secure my account and give specific access to the account and the key.

### 6: Installing AWS CLI

I used VS Code to install the AWS CLI extention as shown below.
